                <h1>My ideas on this site</h1>
                <p>
                    I watch some people playing boardgames like Pentago, Pyramids, or etc. And I really want to create online version of those games.<br>
                    And I will also upload my other project here.<br>
                    That's all. I'm run out of idea now.

                <h2>Pentago rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The board is divided into 4 square. Each square has 3x3 holes.</li>
                    <li>Each turn, a player do:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place a ball in an unoccupied hole</li>
                        <li>Rotate a square in either direction by 90 degree</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>A player win when there's 5 balls in a row/column/diagonal</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Pyramids rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The board is a square with 4x4 holes. Each player has 15 balls in their deck.</li>
                    <li>Each turn, a player do:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place a ball, either in an unoccupied hole or on other balls</li>
                        <li>If their balls form a 2x2 square, they have to take 2 out of 4 balls back to their deck.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Player whose ball on top of the pyramid win</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe with a twist</h2>
                <p>
                    There's only 3 Xs and 3 Os. If players run out of their X/O, they have to move one of their X/O on the board.<br>
                    The first player to get 3 in a row win.
